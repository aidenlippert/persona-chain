## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Fort Knox Security Principles**
1. **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers
3. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Minimal access rights
4. **End-to-End Encryption** - Data encrypted at rest and in transit
5. **Hardware Security Modules** - Key material never in software
6. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography** - Future-proof security

### **Current Security Assessment**
- **CRITICAL**: No HSM integration (keys in software)
- **CRITICAL**: No formal threat model
- **HIGH**: No penetration testing performed
- **HIGH**: No security monitoring/alerting
- **MEDIUM**: TypeScript errors may indicate security gaps
