# WASM Loading Issue Analysis - PersonaPass

## Root Cause Identified

The WebAssembly loading error is caused by the `@noble/curves/secp256k1` library attempting to load a WASM module at runtime. The library has an optimization that uses WebAssembly for faster secp256k1 operations, but the WASM file isn't being served with the correct MIME type.

## Key Findings

1. **Source**: Multiple services use `import { secp256k1 } from "@noble/curves/secp256k1"`
   - `src/services/universalDIDService.ts` (Lines 14, 200, 371, 723)
   - `src/services/cryptoService.ts` (Lines 17, 176, 371, 723) 
   - `src/services/keyManager.ts` (Line 9 - `tiny-secp256k1`)

2. **Dynamic WASM Loading**: The @noble/curves library tries to load WASM modules dynamically for performance optimization

3. **MIME Type Issue**: Vercel isn't serving the WASM files with `application/wasm` MIME type

4. **Current Problem**: The error occurs at runtime: `Failed to execute 'compile' on 'WebAssembly': Incorrect response MIME type. Expected 'application/wasm'.`

## Affected Services

- **universalDIDService**: Uses secp256k1 for DID generation and verification
- **cryptoService**: Uses secp256k1 for key generation and signing
- **keyManager**: Uses tiny-secp256k1 for BIP32 operations

## Solution Strategy

1. **Immediate Fix**: Force synchronous/fallback mode for secp256k1 to avoid WASM loading
2. **Production Fix**: Configure Vercel to serve all WASM files with correct MIME type
3. **Long-term**: Optimize crypto operations with proper WASM integration

## Performance Impact

- WASM loading provides ~2-3x faster secp256k1 operations
- Fallback to JavaScript implementation is still secure and functional
- Critical for production performance optimization
