# WASM Loading Issue Investigation

## Current Status
- **Error**: "Failed to execute 'compile' on 'WebAssembly': Incorrect response MIME type. Expected 'application/wasm'."
- **Location**: `index-1jYFLt53.js:76` (main application bundle)
- **User Report**: Error persists despite previous vercel.json MIME type fixes

## WASM Files Found in Dist
```
/home/rocz/persona-chain/dist/circuits/build/simple_age_proof_js/simple_age_proof.wasm
/home/rocz/persona-chain/dist/circuits/build/age_verification_js/age_verification.wasm
/home/rocz/persona-chain/dist/circuits/build/simple_income_proof_js/simple_income_proof.wasm
/home/rocz/persona-chain/dist/circuits/build/income_threshold_js/income_threshold.wasm
```

## JS Files Referencing WASM
- Main bundle: `dist/assets/index-1jYFLt53.js`
- ZK components: Multiple ZK-related bundled files
- Circuit generators: All circuit build directories contain `generate_witness.js`

## Root Cause Analysis
The error is likely NOT from our circuit WASM files, but from the @noble/curves/secp256k1 library attempting to load its own WASM modules dynamically. This library uses WASM for performance optimization of elliptic curve operations.

## Next Steps
1. Configure @noble/curves to disable WASM usage (fallback to JS)
2. Or ensure all WASM files have proper MIME types in deployment
3. Verify the issue is resolved by testing secp256k1 operations

## Evidence Required
- Test secp256k1 key generation in browser console
- Check network requests for WASM file fetches
- Confirm MIME type headers on production deployment
